  <div class="AboutNepal">
    <p>Nepal ,formerly the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal (Nepali: सङ्घीय
      लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्र नेपाल), is a landlocked country in South Asia. It is mainly situated in the Himalayas, but
      also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, bordering Tibet of China to the north, and India in the south,
      east, and
      west, while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor, and from Bhutan by the Indian state
      of
      Sikkim.
      The name "Nepal" is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent, the
      era in ancient
      Nepal
      when Hinduism was founded, the predominant religion of the country. In the middle of the first millennium BC,
      Gautama
      Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal. Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined
      with
      the culture of Tibet. The centrally located Kathmandu Valley is intertwined with the culture of Indo-Aryans, and
      was the
      seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala. The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road
      was
      dominated by the valley's traders. The cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional art and architecture.
      By
      the
      18th century, the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal. The Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of
      Nepal
      and later formed an alliance with the British Empire, under its Rana dynasty of premiers. <a

    <p>The history of Nepal is intertwined with the history of the broader Indian subcontinent and the surrounding
      regions,
      comprising the areas of South Asia and East Asia.

      Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multiracial, multicultural, multi-religious, and multilingual country. The most spoken
      language
      is Nepali followed by several other ethnic languages.

      The Kingdom of Nepal was established in 1768 and started a campaign of unifying what would form the modern
      territories
      of Nepal. Some former territories had been lost due to the kingdom having participated in the Sino-Nepalese War
      which
      ended in both victory and loses, ultimately accepting as a tribute state of Qing dynasty of China from 1792 to
      1865.
      The Anglo-Nepalese War ended in British victory and ceded some Nepalese territory. In a historical vote for the
      election
      of the constituent assembly, the Nepalese parliament voted to abolish the monarchy in June 2006. Nepal became a
      federal
      republic on 28 May 2008 and was formally renamed the 'Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal' ending the
      200-year-old
      reign of the Shah monarchs.Although very little is known about the early history of Nepal, legends and documented
      references reach far back to the
      30th century BC. Also, the presence of historical sites such as the Valmiki ashram, indicates the presence of
      Sanatana (ancient) Hindu culture in parts of Nepal at that period.

    <p>The politics of Nepal functions within the framework of a parliamentary republic with a multi-party system.
      Executive
      power is exercised by the Prime Minister and their cabinet, while legislative power is vested in the Parliament.

      The Governing Nepali Congress and CPN (UML) have been the main rivals of each other since the early 1990s with
      each
      party defeating the other in successive elections. It has seven political parties mainly recognised in
      the
      federal parliament Nepali Congress (NC), CPN (UML), CPN(Maoist-centre), CPN(Unified Socialist), PSP-N,
      Loktantrik
      Samajwadi Party, Nepal and People's Progressive Party. While all major parties officially espouse democratic
      socialism, UML, Unified Socialist and Maoist-centre is considered leftist while Nepali Congress, Democratic
      Socialist. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Nepal" target="_blank">Read more</a></p>
