  <h2><b id="about">Nepal</b></h2>
  <div class="AboutNepal">
    <p>Nepal ,formerly the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal (Nepali: सङ्घीय
      लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्र नेपाल), is a landlocked country in South Asia. It is mainly situated in the Himalayas, but
      also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, bordering Tibet of China to the north, and India in the south,
      east, and
      west, while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor, and from Bhutan by the Indian state
      of
      Sikkim. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the
      world's ten
      tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual,
      multi-religious and multi-cultural state, with Nepali as the official language. Kathmandu is the nation's capital
      and
      the largest city.

      The name "Nepal" is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent, the era in ancient
      Nepal
      when Hinduism was founded, the predominant religion of the country. In the middle of the first millennium BC,
      Gautama
      Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal. Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined
      with
      the culture of Tibet. The centrally located Kathmandu Valley is intertwined with the culture of Indo-Aryans, and
      was the
      seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala. The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road was
      dominated by the valley's traders. The cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional art and architecture. By
      the
      18th century, the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal. The Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of
      Nepal
      and later formed an alliance with the British Empire, under its Rana dynasty of premiers. The country was never
      colonised but served as a buffer state between Imperial China and British India. Parliamentary democracy was
      introduced
      in 1951 but was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs, in 1960 and 2005. The Nepalese Civil War in the 1990s and
      early
      2000s resulted in the establishment of a secular republic in 2008, ending the world's last Hindu monarchy.

      The Constitution of Nepal, adopted in 2015, affirms the country as a secular federal parliamentary republic
      divided into
      seven provinces. Nepal was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and friendship treaties were signed with India
      in
      1950 and China in 1960. Nepal hosts the permanent secretariat of the South Asian Association for Regional
      Cooperation
      (SAARC), of which it is a founding member. Nepal is also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Bay of
      Bengal
      Initiative. The Nepalese Armed Forces are the fifth-largest in South Asia; and are notable for their Gurkha
      history,
      particularly during the world wars, and has been a significant contributor to United Nations peacekeeping
      operations. <a class="Readmore" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal" target="_blank">Read more</a></p>

    <p>The history of Nepal is intertwined with the history of the broader Indian subcontinent and the surrounding
      regions,
      comprising the areas of South Asia and East Asia.

      Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multiracial, multicultural, multi-religious, and multilingual country. The most spoken
      language
      is Nepali followed by several other ethnic languages.

      The Kingdom of Nepal was established in 1768 and started a campaign of unifying what would form the modern
      territories
      of Nepal. Some former territories had been lost due to the kingdom having participated in the Sino-Nepalese War
      which
      ended in both victory and loses, ultimately accepting as a tribute state of Qing dynasty of China from 1792 to
      1865.
      The Anglo-Nepalese War ended in British victory and ceded some Nepalese territory. In a historical vote for the
      election
      of the constituent assembly, the Nepalese parliament voted to abolish the monarchy in June 2006. Nepal became a
      federal
      republic on 28 May 2008 and was formally renamed the 'Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal' ending the
      200-year-old
      reign of the Shah monarchs.Although very little is known about the early history of Nepal, legends and documented
      references reach far back to the
      30th century BC. Also, the presence of historical sites such as the Valmiki ashram, indicates the presence of
      Sanatana (ancient) Hindu culture in parts of Nepal at that period.

      According to legendary accounts, the early rulers of Nepal were the Gopālavaṃśi (Gopal Bansa) or "cowherd
      dynasty", who
      presumably ruled for about five centuries. They are said to have been followed by the Mahiṣapālavaṃśa or
      "buffalo-herder
      dynasty", established by a Yadav named Bhul Singh.

      The Shakya clan formed an independent oligarchic republican state known as the 'Śākya Gaṇarājya' during the late
      Vedic
      period (c. 1000 – c. 500 BCE) and the later so-called second urbanisation period (c. 600 – c. 200 BCE).[14] Its
      capital
      was Kapilavastu, which may have been located either in present-day Tilaurakot, Nepal. Gautama Buddha (c. 6th
      to 4th centuries BCE), whose teachings became the foundation of Buddhism, was the best-known Shakya. He was known
      in his
      lifetime as "Siddhartha Gautama" and "Shakyamuni" (Sage of the Shakyas). He was the son of Śuddhodana, the elected
      leader of the Śākya Gaṇarājya. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Nepal" target="_blank">Read

    <p>The politics of Nepal functions within the framework of a parliamentary republic with a multi-party system.[1]
      Executive
      power is exercised by the Prime Minister and their cabinet, while legislative power is vested in the Parliament.

      The Governing Nepali Congress and CPN (UML) have been the main rivals of each other since the early 1990s with
      each
      party defeating the other in successive elections.[2][3][4] It has seven political parties mainly recognised in
      the
      federal parliament Nepali Congress (NC),[1] CPN (UML), CPN(Maoist-centre), CPN(Unified Socialist), PSP-N,
      Loktantrik
      Samajwadi Party, Nepal and People's Progressive Party.[1] While all major parties officially espouse democratic
      socialism, UML, Unified Socialist and Maoist-centre is considered leftist while Nepali Congress, Democratic
      Socialist
      Party and People's Progressive Party are considered centrist, with most considering it center-left and some
      center-right.[5] The party PSP-N is center-left to left-wing.[6] During most of the brief periods of democratic
      exercise
      in the 1950s as well as the 1990s, Nepali Congress held a majority in parliament.[7] Following the entry of the
      Maoists
      into the political process, they were the largest party in the first constituent assembly and Nepali Congress was
      the
      largest in the second, with no party winning a majority.[8] In second constituent assembly Nepali Congress stood
      first
      without winning a majority. In the aftermath of the 2017 elections, the first one according to the new
      constitution, NCP
      had become the ruling party at the federal level as well as six out of seven provinces.[9] While Nepali Congress
      has a
      significantly reduced representation. Still NCP couldn't live long due to intra party dispute and was split to
      back in
      2017 when UML and Maoist-centre were present independently. <a
